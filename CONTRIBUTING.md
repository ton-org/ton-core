# Contributing

- Open an issue before creating a PR. It's best to discuss possible solutions before implementing them. A lot of work can be wasted otherwise.
- Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md). It's hard to keep track of updates by commits in `main`.
- Check the code compiles and runs.
- Add tests to demonstrate the contribution is correctly implemented. Include at least
    - Positive tests, showing the happy path(s)
    - Negative tests, featuring intentionally broken cases
